Mahir coded the receiver (client) side, while Victor worked on the sender
(server) side for the full extent of the project. We took an iterative 
approach to meet the requirements given in the specification provided by the 
teaching assistant. 

We first started by implementing a UDP client-server interaction without any 
noise (i.e. packet loss, corruption). We ensured that it can send and receive 
messages before dividing them into packets. 

We then introduced packet loss and corruption. Victor defined a function to 
simulate packet loss and corruption that is used at both ends. Victor also 
implemented a timeout to handle packet loss and corruption. 

During each phase, we helped debug each other's code when we faced obstacles.
